I have cloned down the catppuccin theme for nvim, Take the structure inspiration from './catppuccin-github/' which is the cloned github.

I want to port this colorscheme from zed to neovim './reppucin.json' but using the structure of catppuccin-github
If there is any thing missing please ask me. 

You can exclude all of the flavours from the catppuccin-github folder and just use the reppuccin.json file.
There will only be one flavour.

I still want to use the ability for me and others to configure the colorscheme with lazy.nvim

The current version of nvim is 0.11.5
